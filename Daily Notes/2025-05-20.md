## **Today's Tasks**
- [ADAPT-9962](https://jeavio.atlassian.net/browse/ADAPT-9962) : Mobile Responsive - Release Notes Link- Screen
	- There is a release note screen, that we need to make mobile friendly.
	- Time target 3 hrs.

## **Daily TO-DO**

- [x] Check-Out 

## Notes

- In task of notes deletion, there is a catch: When we delete a note, the API call with that search term is mutated, but the API call with empty search term is not. So when we clear the search, the deleted note is visible.

- #### Notes for [ADAPT-11680](https://jeavio.atlassian.net/browse/ADAPT-11680)
	- There is a table called `tbl_project_integrations`, where there is a field 'active'. Add check here before registering to celery. If not active then don't register.
