# What Actually Matters When Building a Solution?

When I started coding, the biggest flex was just getting things to work.
project compiled? full marks.
But after entering the industry, I realized... that it's just a starting line, not the finish line.

In college we built an app for a project. Clean code, a beautiful UI, some cool features.
But we built it wearing developer goggles - not user lenses.
We nailed the code... and missed the point.

We forgot to ask ourselves:
Is this useful? Intuitive? Would anyone actually use this?
We built what we thought was cool - not what users actually needed.

Since joining the industry, one thing been obvious:
*A great product isn’t the one that just works — it’s the one people love to use.*

Now I try to think: 
Is this solving a real problem?
Is this effortless to use?
Would I enjoy using this if I weren't the builder?

We don't just write code - we design experiences.
User's don't care about your cleanest API or cleverest state logic. They care about if it works for them. (That doesn't mean you write messy code)
